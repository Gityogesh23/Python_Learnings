There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done 
with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to 
define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing 
all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string 
literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer 
literals and float literals
