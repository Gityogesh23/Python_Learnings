# WHILE LOOP-->
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   i += 1
  # Note:Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
  # The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

#BREAK STATEMENT-->
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   if i == 3:
#     break
#   i += 1
#
  #CONTINUE STATEMENT

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue
#   print(i)

# THE ELSE STATEMENT-->

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
