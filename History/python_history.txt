Python History & Evolution--->

1. Python (Early Development)

Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

Designed to be simple, readable, and powerful.

Influenced by ABC language.

# Python 1.x (1991–2000)
⭐ Key Features

Basic data types (int, float, str)

Functions, modules, error handling

First stable version: Python 1.0 (1994)

This was mainly foundational.

# Python 2.x (2000–2020)
⭐ Major improvements

Unicode support (partial)

List comprehensions

Garbage collection

Better libraries

The most famous versions:

Python 2.4

Python 2.7 (long-term)

🔚 Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020 → “End of Life”.

# Python 3.x (2008–Present)

Python 3 fixed many design problems in Python 2.

⭐ Major changes

Full Unicode support (UTF-8)

Better standard library

Improved I/O (print() as function)

Type hints (typing)

Async/await

Performance improvements

Popular versions:

Python 3.6 (f-strings)

Python 3.8 / 3.9

Python 3.10 (pattern matching)

Python 3.11 (huge speed boost)

Python 3.12 (even faster)

# Current Python Version in 2025

The latest stable version is usually:

👉 Python 3.12 or Python 3.13
(3.13 released in 2024 — faster, better error messages)

✔ Industry Standard Today

Most companies use:

Python 3.10

Python 3.11

Python 3.12

Python 2 is not used anymore, except in very old legacy systems.

🐳 What is “Alpine”? (Very Important in DevOps / Docker)
❓ Is Alpine a Python version?

❌ No.
Alpine is not a Python version.

✔ What Alpine actually is:

Alpine Linux = a very small, lightweight Linux distribution.

Used in Docker images to reduce image size.

Example:

python:3.10-slim → lighter than normal

python:3.10-alpine → ultra lightweight

📌 Why use Alpine?

✔ Very small (~5 MB)
✔ Faster deployments
✔ Good for microservices
✔ Secure (musl libc)

📌 Why not use Alpine sometimes?

⚠ Some Python packages (like NumPy, pandas, SciPy) don’t work well on Alpine because:

Alpine uses musl, not glibc.

Many libraries need compiled C extensions.

So for ML or heavy systems → don’t use Alpine
Use → python:3.10-slim or ubuntu.

| Name                         | Meaning              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Alpine**                   | Super small Linux    |
| **Slim**                     | Small Debian         |
| **Buster/Bullseye/Bookworm** | Debian versions      |
| **Ubuntu**                   | Ubuntu-based image   |
| **Windows**                  | Windows Server-based |
--------------------------------------------------------
# Which Python image should you use?
If you are doing general backend / FastAPI / Flask

👉 python:3.10-slim

If you need ML / AI / NumPy / Pandas

👉 python:3.10-bullseye or python:3.10-bookworm

If you want tiny image for microservice

👉 python:3.10-alpine
(but avoid if using scientific libs)

If project must run on Windows

👉 python:3.10-windowsservercore

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Python 1**          | Foundation version                           |
| **Python 2**          | Popular for many years, retired in 2020      |
| **Python 3**          | Current and modern Python                    |
| **Latest version**    | Python 3.12 / 3.13 (2025)                    |
| **Industry use**      | 3.10–3.12                                    |
| **Alpine**            | Lightweight Linux distro, not Python version |
| **Why Alpine**        | small image size                             |
| **When avoid Alpine** | ML, data science packages                    |

#To create Virtual Environment For python3
Command is-->

1) py -3.10 -m venv venv310
Note-->For Devops pyenv is Popular to go with it.


| User Type      | Best Method                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Beginner       | Official Installer + py launcher   |
| Developer      | py launcher + virtual environments |
| DevOps         | pyenv-win                          |
| Data Scientist | Anaconda                           |

command-->winget install pyenv-win  (winget is Windows Package Manager -->runs in Poweeshell of Vscode but not on ubuntu,wsl,git Bash etc.)
| Environment             | winget | pyenv-win | pyenv (Linux) |
